Overcoming the limitations of traditional web technologies such as polling, long-polling, streaming, AJAX a nd introducing the features of Web Socket technology, analyzing the difference between Web Socket protocol and HTTP protocol, offer an approach to implementing the Web Socket both in client and server side. This paper shows a new algorithm for detecting objects in motion from a background at rest scene based on frame difference. Firstly, the first frame or image is captured through the static camera and after that number of frames are being captured at regular intervals of time. Secondly, the major difference is calculated between the consecutive and multiple frames and the difference in the  image is stored inside the system. Thirdly, the difference image is converted into a gray image and then translated into a binary image.
